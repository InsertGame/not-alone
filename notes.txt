theme: "You're not alone"

vertical platformer

pressing a hotkey while falling summons a guardian angel to reset
you back to your last position

at the top you meet the guardian angel?

you're not alone could also have a creepy astetic to it
tho im pretty sure most people are going for that

other previously mentioned ideas:

"ooh for youre not alone, maybe you 
are trying to find someone else"

"youre not alone, maybe some portal-esque 
feel with a robot voice" i dont rly wanna do this cuz of the voice acting required
could just use tts
absolutely not
sacrelig
perchance
could use text that appears like classic dialogue systems
ok maybe not that
or maybe that depends on the style of game we were making
tho probs shouldnt pause the game for the dialogue if mid-jump
