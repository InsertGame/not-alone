UPDATE 1.0

ice: slippery (no friction) (less maybe?)
coins: just go "bleep" and vanish when touched (client side only)
trampoline/something else maybe: when you land on it, it
bounces you back up to the same height
construction/industrial tiles

UPDATE 1.1
conveyor belts work right now

IDEAS FOR FUTURE UPDATES

tiles that do new things

jetpack: instead of jump you now fly
jetpack removal: removes your jetpack
bounce pad: bounces you in the direction it faces
crumble: breaks on touch
key: when collected act like smm key and follow you (maybe
reuse fuqer code??)
key block: when touched while you have a key, remove this and
all adjacent key blocks

decor
magma/lava tiles
techy tiles
city tiles

FX TILES:
each tile can have an fx tile
0,0 : 0,0-fx
fg_0,0 : fg_0,0-fx
npc_0,0 : npc_0,0-fx
allows certain effects to be placed on individual tiles
EFFECTS:
mirage: disables collision and fades away on touch
ghost: fades into existance when near
bounce: makes the tile bounce up (does not change collision)
float: makes the tile bob up and down slowly

-------- OLD --------
NEW LAYER:
FX layer

BG and FG layers house tiles, NPC layer handles NPCS, and
the FX layer is for effect tiles

something as simple as a FG FADE tile fx, that when placed
on top of tiles, causes the foreground tile to have no
collision and fade out when you get near, like a secret
path inside the walls

fx ideas:

FG FADE - removes collision of foreground and fades it out
as you get near
NPC HOP - makes the npc appear as if it were hopping up
and down
NPC HIDE - hides the npc and always shows dialogue
FLIP - vertically flips any tiles and npcs
